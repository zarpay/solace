### Changed

THESE ARE BREAKING CHANGES FROM 0.0.2 TO 0.0.3. Solice is still in alpha and the API is subject to change. 

There was a bit of a refactoring of the codebase to make it more maintainable and to make it easier to add new features. Additonally, the SDK now has `Composers` for handling accounts and instructions in a higher level abstraction. These composers are used in the tests and can be used in your own code as well.

Soon, YARD documentation will be added to the SDK and published to https://solace-rb.github.io/solace/. 

Stay tuned.
